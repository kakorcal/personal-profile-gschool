        <p>Hi there! My name is Ken. I was born inside an American naval base located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa" target='_blank'>Yokosuka, Japan</a>. For a brief time, my family lived in California when I was in elementary school, but I spent most of my teenage years living in Japan. I moved to San Francisco two years ago to study at City College of San Francisco and to visit my brother and sister, who both have been living in the city for six years. I became interested in coding when I started helping my brother-in-law create wordpress websites for his freelance cilents. Currently my life consists of learning Javascript and front-end web development, going to the gym, and selling my stuff on craigslist to pay for muni during the monthes I will be studying at Galvanize. Here is a picture of me, my friend, and master chief from Halo on the left. <a href="goals.html">Click here</a> to go the next page.</p>
